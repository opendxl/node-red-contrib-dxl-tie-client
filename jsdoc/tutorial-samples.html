    <p>The McAfee Threat Intelligence Exchange (TIE) DXL Node-RED client package
includes JSON documents with sample Node-RED flows. To import samples into
Node-RED, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>In the upper-right corner of the Node-RED UI, press the side menu button.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Select one of examples under
<code>Import → Examples → dxl tie-client</code> in the menu drop-down list.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In order for the sample flows to execute properly, Node-RED must be able to
connect to a DXL fabric. For more information on connecting to a DXL fabric
from Node-RED, see the
<a href="https://opendxl.github.io/node-red-contrib-dxl/jsdoc/tutorial-configuration.html">Client Configuration</a>
section in the OpenDXL Node-RED package documentation.</p>
<p>See the following sections for an overview of each sample.</p>

<h4 id="basic-get-certificate-first-references-basic-get-cert-first-ref-example-">Basic Get Certificate First References (basic-get-cert-first-ref-example)</h4>
<p>This sample invokes the TIE DXL service to retrieve the set of systems which
have referenced a certificate (as identified by hashes).</p>
<h4 id="basic-get-certificate-reputation-basic-get-cert-reputation-example-">Basic Get Certificate Reputation (basic-get-cert-reputation-example)</h4>
<p>This sample invokes the TIE DXL service to retrieve the reputation of a
certificate (as identified by hashes).</p>
<h4 id="basic-get-file-first-references-basic-get-file-first-ref-example-">Basic Get File First References (basic-get-file-first-ref-example)</h4>
<p>This sample invokes the TIE DXL service to retrieve the set of systems which
have referenced a file (as identified by hashes).</p>
<h4 id="basic-get-file-reputation-basic-get-file-reputation-example-">Basic Get File Reputation (basic-get-file-reputation-example)</h4>
<p>This sample invokes the TIE DXL service to retrieve the reputation of a file
(as identified by hashes).</p>
<h4 id="basic-set-certificate-reputation-basic-set-cert-reputation-example-">Basic Set Certificate Reputation (basic-set-cert-reputation-example)</h4>
<p>This sample invokes the TIE DXL service to set the enterprise-specific
<code>trust level</code> of a certificate (as identified by hashes).</p>
<h4 id="basic-set-file-reputation-basic-set-file-reputation-example-">Basic Set File Reputation (basic-set-file-reputation-example)</h4>
<p>This sample invokes the TIE DXL service to set the enterprise-specific

<h3 id="notification-samples">Notification Samples</h3>
<h4 id="basic-detection-event-basic-detection-event-example-">Basic Detection Event (basic-detection-event-example)</h4>
<p>This sample registers with the DXL fabric to receive detection events from
TIE when detections occur on managed systems.</p>
<h4 id="basic-first-instance-event-basic-first-instance-event-example-">Basic First Instance Event (basic-first-instance-event-example)</h4>
<p>This sample registers with the DXL fabric to receive first instance events from
TIE when files are encountered for the first time within the local enterprise.</p>
<h4 id="basic-reputation-change-event-basic-reputation-change-event-example-">Basic Reputation Change Event (basic-reputation-change-event-example)</h4>
<p>This sample registers with the DXL fabric to receive reputation change events
sent by TIE when the reputation of a file or certificate changes.</p>
